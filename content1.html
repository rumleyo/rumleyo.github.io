  <h2 class="no_print">A few words about me</h2>
  <p class="no_print">Until now, in my life, I've changed from active moments with a lot of variety, challenges and improvisations, to moments of tranquility and stability.
  Having moved back and forth between Switzerland and Japan, I now look to settle for good in Japan where my wife and two children have already relocated.</p>
  <p>My work-related dream is to keep learning and making progress in the field of Data Science, which is relatively new and at the same time inspiring to me.
  In the workplace, I strive to think in terms of first principles to guide my efforts in breaking-down and solving challenging problems. 
  I consider myself open minded and result-driven. Although sometimes impatient to reach a goal, I recognize the importance to be tolerant and respectful in the process.</p>
