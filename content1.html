  <h2>A few words about me</h2>
  <p>Until now, in my life, I change from active moments with a lot of variety, challenges and improvisations, to moments of tranquility and stability.
  Having alternated between Switzerland and Japan, I now look to move back definitely to Japan where my wife and two children have already relocated.</p>
  <p>My work-related dream is to keep learning and making progress in the field of Data Science, which is relatively new and at the same time inspiring to me.
  In the workplace, I strive to think in terms of first principles to guide my efforts in breaking-down and solving challenging problems.
  I consider myself open minded and result-driven. Although sometimes impatient to reach a goal, I recognize the importance to be tolerant and respectful in the process.</p>

  <h2>Philosophy</h2>
  <p>I believe in ethic and moral not in imposed rules that you "have to" do or follow.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, as a human being with rationality, I think it is our duty to take care of the world and treat others as one would like others to treat oneself. </p>
