  <h2>Specifics about my current employment</h2>
</div>
<div class="block">
  <p>Based at a large scale wristwatch manufacturing located in Geneva Switzerland, the site produces all components and sub-assemblies except for the movement and dials of high-end mechanical watches.
  My main responsibility lies in the conversion of the geometrical product specifications designed by the engineering department into manufacturing & control specifications, in conformity with the original tolerances at all manufacturing phases of the WIP and end product.
  The scope regards all new projects and includes calculation for existing products being adapted to new manufacturing processes.
  The tools used to ensure geometrical conformity ranges from single phase 2D trigonometry calculation to 3D multiple phases simulations.

	<tr><td>Workload Management System</td><td>Employee Workload Planner and Activity Tracker</td>
		<td>Designed and developed from scratch a standalone suite of tools in VBA for logging, tracking, reporting, and planning work activities. 
		Currently being used daily by a team of 12 persons. 
		Working principle: the main user interface is the Ms Outlook calendar where the user enters regular meetings and events which are then tagged with labels using a VBA macro that embeds the information in the custom properties of the events.
		Another VBA macro is used to input and manage workloads which have due dates and an amount of hours estimated on previously completed tasks of similar nature. 
		The user can one-click synchronize the workloads and calendar, at which point, the program extracts existing events from calendar, 
		distribute in a prioritized fashion the workloads and insert workload events into the calendar with the daily amount of expected work hours. It warns of any due date slippage.
		Upon completing a daily workload, the user can one-click the planned event into a realised work which the program will use to calculate the remaining hours to completion of the total hours.
		The manager has a dashboard to track all activities and plannings. For new project workloads, the program can point to the employees by availability order that can take on the workloads in a timely fashion.
		The program has roughly 30k lines of code and structured with classes for ease of development, and nested modal user forms for ease of use.
		The workload data is stored in a custom database in Ms Access format.

    <tr><td>Product Data Analysis</td><td>Use Case Impact</td>
		<td>Developed from scratch a tool in VBA Excel with library for manipulating native array objects (for efficiency purpose) 
		    that takes in the entire data of product items and associated CAD objects as inputs, and produce a complete map of related product items as output for thorough versioning deployment.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Product Data Governance</td><td>Product Items Association</td>
		<td>Foreword : The Concept Product Items and Manufacturing Product Items are two distinct data sets, managed by two different internal services in a PLM environment. 
		However there is a necessary dependency where a manufacturing product item must follow requirements set by a related concept product item.
		That association is critical for proper propagation of requirement updates and quality traceability. It is labor intensive, error prone, and object to a governance process.
		<br>Objective : the projects aims at automating the process of pairing both sets of items by analysing item features such as the designations, material, Bill of Material.
		<br>Strategy : apply multi-pronged approaches relying both on rule-based algorithms and machine learning to establish the most reliable results
		<br>Rule-based include coherence between material, characteristics given by tokenized item designations, and underlying associations between CAD objects and product items.
		<br>Machine-learning basically uses Missing Forest to predict the equivalent item features in the other item space, and then look for closest matches using Nearest Neighbour
		<br>Challenges : many to many associations depending on the stage of product development and product status.

	<tr><td>Advanced Form</td><td>Manufacturing Compliant Criteria Check(Cahier Metiers)</td>
	<td>Objective : In order to flag, as early as possible in the development phase of a product, the potential risks against known manufacturing constraints, 
	the geometrical specifications of a new product is checked against a list of complex criteria early in the industrial phase. Multiple users must be able to edit simultaneously the checklist, which must be filtered and have visual details of each criteria.
	<br>Strategy : implemented a VBA coded user form in Excel linked to a database in Access for project data (user editable) and csv files and images for criteria description (admin editable). 
	Each project specific component characteristics are set initially by the Engineering department. These characteristics are then used to filter the relevant criteria each time a subsequent user open the project file.
	Each criteria is compared against historical data, evaluated, and reviewed for design changes if required.
